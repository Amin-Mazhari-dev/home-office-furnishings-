## About the Project

This is a simple furniture store website designed to showcase products for home, office, and bedroom spaces.

The project is built using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, without relying on any CSS frameworks like Bootstrap.  
This decision was intentional, aiming to demonstrate my ability to design and implement responsive layouts, interactive components, and UI elements from scratch.

By avoiding pre-built components, I focused on writing clean, custom code to highlight my understanding of core web technologies.
